  |   Assassin's Creed III is on Nintendo Switch for the first time and,    |
  |   based on players' feedback, gameplay mechanics have been improved,    |
  |   with several features being revamped.                                 |

  |   The year is 1775. The American colonies are about to revolt. You      |
  |   are Connor, an assassin who has sworn to secure liberty for his       |
  |   people and his nation. To do so, you will hunt your enemies across    |
  |   a staggeringly large, open, and realistic world. You will unleash     |
  |   your lethal skills in a violent quest that will take you from         |
  |   chaotic city streets to blood-soaked battlefields in the hostile      |
  |   American wilderness and beyond. You will meet legendary heroes of     |
  |   American history, and together you will conspire to annihilate        |
  |   those who threaten Liberty itself.                                    |

  |   seeking to crush the American Revolution and control the thirteen     |
  |   colonies. Shocked into action by the devastation of your village,     |
  |   you pledge your life to the cause of freedom, and embark on a         |
  |   decades-long quest to achieve it.                                     |
  |                                                                         |
